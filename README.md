# CAB_Simulations
This repository contains a collection of cellular automata / agent-based simulations using the ComplexAutomataBase (CAB) framework.


## Foraging Ant

Foraging Ant describes the teamwork of ants on their mission to find food and deliver it back to their anthill. By using two sorts of pheromones to mark their trails back and forth, these tiny soldiers manage to implicity communicate with one another and eventually create a nearly optimized trail.

Simple features as

* individually simulated ants, acting according to only two primitive rules
* individually simulated world cells
* pheromone trails evaporating over time

lead to an organic seeming behavior and lively little anthills.


## Sugarscape [Under Construction]

The Sugarscape is a world of sugar and spice. Agents will roam the land and harvest the resources to stay alive. Agents can mate and create offspring that will carry on their genes. Simple rules allow for complex behavior, leading to migrations, diseases, population fluctuations, trading and more.
