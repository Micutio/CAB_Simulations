Development of Cities in Cellular Automata - Notes

---

The general idea of this simulation is to understand how human settlements and cities emerge, grow and sprawl. We want
to find a cellular automaton that is able to simulate a realistic growth using rules that are kept as simple as possible.

The general idea is to start off with a CA terrain where cells contain altitude values, ranging from below sea level
(which would be lakes, rivers and oceans) over lowlands and highlands all the way to mountains. Additionally a cell
also has a food value, which is influenced by altitude and slope (variance of neighboring cell altitudes).


1) Food-based model

A first simple model would be to spawn a city on cells with a high enough food value. Once a city is "founded" it
increases the food value of adjacent cells over time, which allows it to spread. Additional rules will be necessary to
emulate growth limits and recession of cities.


2) Industry-addition

If the simple food-based model works, industry - or production - could be modeled in a similar manner. Cells can then
have natural resources which further stimulate city growth. In later iterations of the model, that will inevitably
contain RICO-zones, these will be vital for industrial zones.


3) Commerce

Apart from food and production, commerce is the third major driver for city emergence and growth.
How this can be modeled I have no idea yet.
