"""
Main module of the urban development simulation.
This shall be used to experiment with growth models of cities or urban areas in
general.

Idea of v1.0:
    Three different types of land use (residential, commercial, industrial).
    Residental cells grow/are created when there is a lot of commerce.
    Commercial cells grow/are created when there is a lot of industry.
    Industrial cells grow/are created when there is a lot of residents.
    Residental cells are negatively impacted by nearby industrial cells.

    Look into the following entities and how they can be incorporated:
    - roads
    |--> making distant cells available
    - natural resources
    |--> create incentives for settlements
    |--> create boost for industry
    - terrain
    |--> promote/inhibit spreading rate of cells
    - agents
    |--> flow of goods and people
